       <h1>Setting Up Isn&#39;t Hard To Do</h1>
       <p>Let&#39;s be honest: New software can be a giant pain. There&#39;s the constant worry that you won&#39;t be able to figure out how to use it, or that the Global Thermonuclear War game is hooked into NORAD somehow.</p>
       <p>We understand. You might think that kind of thing wouldn&#39;t happen to nerds like us. But being a nerd means we get to see software written by nerds, <em>for nerds</em>. Some of that stuff goes beyond user-unfriendly to user-<em>hostile</em>. We feel your pain.  That&#39;s why we made Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick worry-free.</p>
       <h2>Help is Everywhere</h2>
       <p>Every page has instructions on how to use it. In case the instructions aren&#39;t enough, each page also links to a help page. In case the help page doesn&#39;t answer your question, it links to the tech support forum. Most help pages also have links to short instructional videos explaining the site. Like the links in the next section.</p>
       <h2>See for Yourself</h2>
       <p>The second-best way to see how easy it is to get up and running with Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick is to watch our video tours. (The best way is to just <a href="plans">sign up</a> for a risk-free trial.)</p>

         <li>Create a school <span>by entering an account name for everyone at your school to use to log in, like <span title="That's Selinsgrove, PA, located midway between the state capitol and the Little League Hall of Fame, and one-time home of the world's longest banana split">selinsgrove</span>.littleredbrick.com.</span></li>
         <li>Set dates <span>for the term and marking periods to help automatically calculate grades.</span></li>

         <li>Assign schedules <span>for teachers. You can enter teacher schedules manually or by uploading the data from a spreadsheet, or have teachers enter their schedules themselves.</span></li>
