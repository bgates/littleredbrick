      <h1>Questions About LittleRedBrick</h1>
<dl id="questions">
<dt>What is this good for?</dt><dd>Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick is for: <ul>
<li><em>Administrators</em> who want to know more about academic performance at their school, from a school-wide analysis of every English Composition class to a comparison of a new math teacher's sections vs the rest of her department to checking on changes in one particular student's grade over the last week</li>
<li><em>Teachers</em> who want to find out if a problem child in their classroom is a star in someone else&#39;s, or offer online tutoring sessions after school</li>
<li><em>Parents</em> who demand up-to-the-minute information on everything about their children&#39;s school experience, including current grades, recent assignment scores, and future homework schedules
</li>
<li><em>Students</em>, because it helps you keep everyone at the school accountable for their roles in improving student performance</li></ul></dd>

<dt>How hard is it to use?</dt><dd>Not at all. Each page of the site has its own help page, and there are also video tutorials that explain everything you can do as an administrator or teacher. You can also use our online forums to get tech support.</dd>

<dt>What kind of computer do I need?</dt><dd>All you need is an internet connection and a web browser, and what you&#39;re using now is probably fine. We have tested Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick in Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8, Firefox 3, and Safari.</dd>

<dt>How do I pay for it?</dt><dd>We&#39;re flexible, and we understand your school or district may not be. Go ahead and create an account and start using it, and we&#39;ll contact you to work out payment.</dd>

<dt>What if I decide to cancel?</dt><dd>No problem. Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick is billed monthly, and you can cancel at any time. If you would like to keep copies of any of your data, let us know and we will send it to you.</dd>

<dt>How much is it?</dt><dd>Ah, now that&#39;s the kind of question you should ask on the <a href="plans">signup page</a>.</dd>
