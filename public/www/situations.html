       <h1>Simple Setup for Administrators</h1>
        <h2>Question 1: Do all the sections of Algebra I have close to the same average grade and grade distribution?</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Click the "Admin" tab to see the Administrator-specific areas of the site</li>
         <li>Click the "Catalog" link</li>
         <li>In the table of departments and subjects, click "Algebra I"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This pulls up a wealth of information about every Algebra I class at the school, including average grade for the marking period, the distribution of those grades (how many A's, B's, and C's), the number of assignments given during the term and marking period, and more</p>
        <h2>Question 2: How is Hector Gonzalez doing in English this week?</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Click the "Students" tab to bring up a table of all students and their class schedules</li>
         <li>Find Hector's name and click on it</li>
         <li>This page will show you summaries of Hector's performance in all his classes. To focus on the English class, find the line that contain its name followed by Hector's name, and click "Hector".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hector's English class page has a comprehensive view of his performance in the class presented in an easy-to-read format. At the top of the page is Hector's grade for the current marking period and his rank in the English class. Next are two graphs. One shows how many points the teacher has assigned in different categories (homework, tests, essays, etc) and Hector's performance in each one. The other charts the progression of Hector's grade through the marking period.</p>
        <p>Next come tables of recent and upcoming assignments. Under the heading of "Recently Graded Assignments" you will find summaries of any graded assignment which was due in the past week, including it's category and point value, Hector's score, and the class average. A link is provided for each assignment to more information, such as the title and teacher's description, as well as scores for every student and the class grade distribution for the assignment. The title "Upcoming/Ungraded Assignments" headlines a table which lists the category, due date, and point value for assignments Hector's teacher plans to collect during the next week, and for any assignments which have been collected but not yet graded.</p>
        <p>Finally, you can get a sense of Hector's participation in the discussion group for the class by reading any comments Hector wrote during the past week.</p>
        <h2>Question 3: Something is broken in this stupid program. What am I supposed to do?</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>There is a "Help" link at the bottom of every page that links to information on how that page should work. Every information page links to other related help pages. If that doesn't answer your question, try step 2.</li>
         <li>Every help page also has a link to the help discussions, where you can ask your question in a forum which can be seen by all school staff members and tech support (or read through the forum to see if your queston has already been asked and answered). </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Question 4: I don't have time to observe every class for every teacher. How can I identify "problem classes" quickly?</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Click the "Teachers" tab to bring up a table showing all teachers and their class schedules</li>
         <li>Click a teacher's name to see a thorough summary of all of that teacher's classes</li>
         <li>Repeat 1 and 2</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The main page for each teacher provides the sort of information shown below for every section the teacher has. These capsule summaries give an immediate sense of what a class is like by highlighting basic facts like the class average and enrollment while also showing finer-grained information like the grade distribution, student workload, and discussion group activity in a clean, intuitive format. If you want to check whether the performance of a particular class is typical for sections of that subject, click the name of the subject to go to the subject page. The organization of the subject page is nearly identical to the teacher page, except that the summaries are of sections which have the same subject instead of the same teacher.</p>
        <p>If you would like to see information about the performance of each student in a section rather than the higher-level view of classwide performance on the teacher or subject pages, follow the "Class Details" link in the summary to the section page. The section page reproduces the summary information for one section beside a table indicating each student's marking period grade, scores on the last few assignments, and activity in the section discussion group.</p>
        <p>Within 30 minutes, you could easily review class data for as many teachers and determine which of their classes bear a closer look.</p>
        <h2>Question 5: How can I use LittleRedBrick to make staff meetings more efficient?</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>[starting a week or so before the staff meeting] Click the "Discussions" tab</li>
         <li>Click the "Staff" link</li>
         <li>Click the "Create a forum" link and give your new forum a name and description ("Staff Meetings" would be catchy)</li>
         <li>Create a topic in the Staff Meetings forum - whatever you want the staff to discuss in advance of the meeting</li>
         <p>Staff meetings can take an awfully long time, for two reasons: some parts are intensely interesting to certain teachers, and some teachers want to argue about everything. By providing a forum for those people to talk about the issues raised in the meeting outside of the meeting, you might be able to keep the in-person discussion more focused. It might be too much to ask to get the arguers to punch themselves out online and then stay quiet in the meeting. But you can hope.</p>
        </ol>
