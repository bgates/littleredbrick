      <h1>About the Name</h1>
      <p>When we chose the name Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick, we were inspired by three things. The first "little red" we had in mind is the iconic little one-room schoolhouse. We had this idea that once upon a time a school was a much simpler place. The kind of place where the entire front office knew exactly how the entire teaching staff was doing, because the front office and the teaching staff were the same guy. The kind of place where all the students' parents were in constant communication with the teacher, because she lived in the same neighborhood as they did. We wanted to make Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick so administrators could experience some of that sense of immediately knowing everything that was going on at a school.</p>
      <p>Since our service involves a lot of computer wizardry, the second "little red" we thought of came from our favorite computer language, Ruby. Ruby was developed by a Japanese Mormon but didn&#39;t really become popular outside of Japan until a Danish guy used it to do some really interesting work for a company in Chicago. Both Yukihiro Matsumoto (that &#39;s the Japanese guy, aka &#8220;Matz&#8221;) and David Hansson (the Danish guy) created these really neat programming tools and then gave them away for free. Without them, this little company and thousands like it couldn&#39;t exist.</p>
      <p>Neither of those guys have any idea who we are, but we would like to do what we can for them. (The slogan of the Ruby community is, &#8220;Matz is nice, so we are nice&#8221;.) I think what I can do for Matz is to suggest that if you have a programming class at your school, look in to using Ruby. That won&#39;t make Matz any money, but all he wants is for people to be happy, and he made Ruby to make programmers happy. If you would like to learn Ruby, <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">this</a> is a pretty good place to start.</p>
      <p>Probably the best thing I can do for David Hansson is give a little plug to his <a href="http://www.37signals.com">business</a>. Their products are geared towards small businesses, but they could be useful in a school setting too.</p>
      <p>The third "little red" behind Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick is the sweet, adorable redheaded wife of our founder. She inspires us to make this the most useful gradebook on the internet, because otherwise our founder will end up sleeping in the yard.</p>
