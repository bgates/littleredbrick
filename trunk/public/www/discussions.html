       <h1 title="No big whoop.">Discussions: Talk Amongst Yourselves</h1>
        <p>Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick&#39;s discussion groups are a great communication tool. They are essentially collections of internet forums (if that doesn&#39;t mean anything to you, think of an organized, permanent version of email list discussions that don&#39;t clutter up your mailbox). Here&#39;s how they work:</p>
        <p>Everyone who can access your school &#39;s Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick site is automatically a member of certain groups. Everyone is a member of the school group; there is a group for staff only, one for staff and parents, one just for teachers, and every class gets a discussion group too. As an administrator, you can write out announcements or topics you want a group to discuss, and post them for everyone in the group to read and respond. Only group members can see the topics and responses in a discussion group. You and your staff can use discussion groups for anything you want to talk about - </p>
        <div id="reasons">
        <h3>Staff Meetings</h3>
        <p>Post agendas. Talk about issues raised in meetings. Tell argumentative teachers to take it up online so the rest of you can keep your meeting on schedule.</p>
        <h3>Union Business</h3>
        <p>Teachers can campaign for union positions. Union reps can report back to the staff about union meetings.</p>
        <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
        <p>Have a staff forum where coaches can discuss roles. Use a school forum to communicate eligibility standards and expectations for student behavior.</p>
        <h3>Class Discussion</h3>
        <p>Teachers can start topics on particular assignments, test review, book discussions, post class rules, and anything else they can imagine.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Your staff can also access a tech support discussion group, where you can find answers to questions about Little<span class="company">Red</span>Brick, suggest new features you would like us to add, and share tips with other users about what you are doing with the site.</p>
       </div>
       <div id="secondary">
         <h2>How Discussion Groups are Organized</h2>
         <ul>
         ��<li>One <em>discussion group</em> has many <em>forums</em></li>
         ��<li>One <em>forum</em> has many <em>topics</em></li>
         ��<li>One <em>topic</em> can have many <em>responses</em></li>
         </ul>
         <p>As an administrator, you create forums for your discussion groups. You decide whether to let other group members add topics. You can edit or remove inappropriate topics and responses.</p>
