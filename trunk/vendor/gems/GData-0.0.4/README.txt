== DESCRIPTION:
  
Google GData APIs allow developers to build applications on top of the Google open APIs. This project aims to help with wrappers on top of GData, and higher level libraries on top of each API itself (e.g. Calendar, Spreadsheet, Blogger, etc).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
To start out the API set isn't covered. The aim is to support the GData API itself, and then higher level classes for the various Google APIs.

Current support:

* Google Account Authentication: Handle Google ClientLogin API
* Google Spreadsheet Data API

Future support:

* Google Calendar API
* Google AdSense API
* Google AdWords API
* Google Base Data API
* Blogger Data API
* Google Code Search API
* Google Data APIs

== SYNOPSIS:

  require_gem 'gdata-ruby'

  % gspreadsheet 'sin(0.2)'

== REQUIREMENTS:

* gem

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install
