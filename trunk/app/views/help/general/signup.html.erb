<p>Before you start, I want to tell you that there's no mistake you can make that can't be fixed. Don't worry about breaking something by clicking the wrong link or the wrong button. Some mistakes may be harder to fix than others, but you can't permanently damage anything. I always worry about that with new software.</p>
<p>OK, the first thing you want to do is to create an address for your school, and a user account so you can access school information at that address. You can do this whether you're a teacher or an administrator.</p>
<p>In either case, go to <a href="www.littleredbrick.com/schools/new">www.littleredbrick.com/schools/new</a> and enter some basic information about your school.</p>
<p>The most important thing on this whole entire first page is the web address. Every school gets its own, and you get to pick the first part of yours (to impress the nerds, we'll call it a 'subdomain'). The web address is what you give out to other people at your school so they can log in, once you create accounts for them.</p>
<div id="notice">
<h3>NOTE FOR TEACHERS</h3>
<p>When you log in, you get access to just that one subdomain (see what I did there? Active vocabulary use). So you may be tempted to use Mr(orMs)TeacherPerson.littleredbrick.com. Fight the temptation. If you're good now, you can have a cookie later. See, the problem with MrTeacherPerson (not you personally, just that name as a subdomain (see, you know what that is now)) is that if you convince your principal to sign up the whole school - you see where I'm going with this? - everybody would have to go to MrTeacherPerson.littleredbrick.com to sign in, even if they're not you. I get queasy just thinking about it. So plan ahead, and use the school name for your subdomain. And use all lowercase. It's the web. We're informal.</p></div>
<p>OK, everybody back together now. The easiest thing is to use your school's name as the subdomain (that's what we're calling the web address, because it's not a help manual without a little bit of jargon). Put it in all lowercase, that's what the kids will type anyway.</p>
<p>Let me know what the name of your school is, too. That's pretty important, because somebody is going to forget the subdomain and just remember littleredbrick.com. And it might be you. When that happens, you'll be all, OMG I totally forgot what to type, and I'll be all, chill just enter your school's real name and I'll remind you, and you'll be all cool kthnxbi.</p>
<p>Let me know the grade range at your school. That just helps set up some forms later. No big whoop.</p>
<p>Tell me a name (could be yours, could confuse the students by calling yourself Captain Marvelous), login and password of your choice, and then the one that scares everybody: I ask for your email.
</p>
<p>But you can say no.</p>
<p>The only reason I want it is in case you forget your login and/or password, you could enter your email and I'd send you a secret link to get back in to the site. (Actually, I wouldn't, the machine would. I'll be on the beach. I mean cubicle! Where I'm hard at work building the next generation of the service. For you, The Customer.)</p>
<p>Last thing, say whether you're a teacher or an administrator. If you're an administrator, you will be able to do everything required to prepare the site up to the point that it's ready for teachers to start entering assignments and grades in their gradebooks. If you're a teacher, you get admin privileges to do the exact same things, plus you can get all the teacher-specific functions. For the purposes of this site, you will be half-admin, half-teacher, like some kind of Frankenprincipal. Just don't let the power go to your head, and remember that you still cannot use the principal's office if there's ANYBODY watching.</p>
<p>One difference between signing up as a teacher vs administrator: An individual teacher may use the site for free, while an administrator will be required to say how many teacher accounts to create (ie, pay for).</p>
<p>Now submit the form. If it worked, skip ahead a paragraph. If not, either you left something blank or someone else chose the subdomain you really wanted. Maybe there's another "Selinsgrove High School" somewhere that already signed up with us. Could happen. In that case, you'll just have to choose a different, equally memorable form of your school's name - for instance, selinsgrove-pa, therealselinsgrove, or nicerthansunbury.</p>
<h3>Log In</h3>
<p>Once you entered information for your school and your personal account into the system, you will be shown the login page. This is to give you a reminder to write down (or bookmark) the address for the login page <i>for your school</i> (which is not just "www.littleredbrick.com"), and to give you a chance to use your login/password combination and let your browser remember it for you if you want.</p>
