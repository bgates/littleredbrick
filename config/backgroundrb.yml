#    :environment: production # use rails production environment

#Then in development:

#ruby script/backgroundrb start

#and in production:

#ruby script/backgroundrb start -e production

#The backgroundrb environment variable loads all of the production variables from the config.yml file (including the rails environment), this isnâ€™t obvious from the documentation and kind of confusing with the double environments.  Hope this helps.
