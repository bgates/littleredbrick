attendance
help, each page
several ways to look at attendance

resource of section: this lets teacher examine/edit attendance for section
section/:section_id/attendance/:id can give attendance for one student over long period

stand-alone resource: so admin can do things like change codes, (run reports?)

resource of student: se one student's attendance in all classes over long period
