 <h2>Passwords</h2>
 <p>As you type in your password, you will see a password strength meter giving you some idea of how difficult your password would be to guess. <noscript>(Note: you will not see this, because your browser does not have Javascript enabled.) </noscript>A strong password includes upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !, @, #, $, etc). One way to create a strong but memorable password is to take a short phrase and substitute certain letters with numbers or symbols. For instance, <em>A Few Good Men</em> <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> <code>@FewG00dMen</code>. Using this method, you can even violate the "no birthdays" rule of strong passwords: <em>February 6 1911</em> &rarr; <code>Febru@ry6!9!!</code></p>
 <h3>Confirming the Password</h3>
 <p>Most sites require you to type your password in a form that looks like this: <%= password_field_tag("name", 'value', :disabled => true) %>, and then confirm it in a form that looks the same. Little<span class='company'>Red</span>Brick has you type the password only once, in text you can see. If you would like to hide what you are typing from other people in the room, click the <code>Hide what I type</code> link above the password box.</p>
