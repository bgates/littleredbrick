<h1>Discussions</h1>
<p>A <strong><%= link_to_unless_current "discussion group", :action_name => 'groups' %></strong> is a part of your school community that might have something in common to talk about, such as all of the teachers, or a particular class. A discussion group has many <strong><%= link_to_unless_current "forums", :action_name => 'forums' %></strong>. A forum is a way to categorize things the discussion group may want to discuss. For instance, a class discussion group could have a forum for homework help, another forum for extra credit, and a third for talk about class rules and policies (to keep students from wasting class time arguing about such things). A forum can contain many <strong><%= link_to_unless_current "topics", :action_name => 'topics' %></strong>. Continuing the example, a class forum for homework could have a topic for each major assignment or each week&#8217;s assignments. Each topic can contain many <strong><%= link_to_unless_current "posts", :action_name => 'posts' %></strong>, which are replies to the topic or to earlier posts.</p>
<h3>Editing Topics and Posts : Moderators</h3>
<p>In any internet forum, but especially in a school forum, there will be concerns about the content of topics and posts. To ensure all posts meet school standards, certain people may be empowered to edit or remove posts in certain topics and forums. These people are called <strong><%= link_to_unless_current "moderators", :action_name => 'moderators' %></strong>. When an administrator creates a forum for the staff, or a teacher creates a forum for a class, that person is automatically a moderator for that forum. A forum creator may also choose other people to be moderators for that forum. To return to the example of a forum for homework help, a teacher may choose an honor student to act as moderator. At the same time, the teacher may not want to allow any students to moderate their class policy forum.</p>
<p>If you are a moderator for a topic, then when you view a topic and its replies (called a thread), every post will have an <code>edit post</code> link. If you are not a moderator, the <code>edit post</code> link will only appear on posts you have written. Click the <code>edit post</code> link on a post to edit or remove it.</p>
<h3>Keeping an Eye on Posts : Monitoring</h3>
<p>If there are not many topics in your discussion groups, it is possible to click through the discussion pages to keep track of them all. In addition, some of the most recent posts will appear on the front page when you log in. However, if the forums become really busy, it becomes difficult to keep track of them all, and you will probably be more interested in some than others. To make sure you can see any activity in the threads on topics that interest you, you can choose to <strong>monitor</strong> those topics. Activity in monitored topics is highlighted on the front page.</p>
