Hi, <%= @user.title.nil?? @user.first_name : @user.display_name %>. Thank you so much for signing up with LittleRedBrick. We admit, this is an automatically generated email, so it lacks something of a personal touch; but whoever you are, we just could not be happier that you're trying us out, and we're sure you will love it.

As a reminder, you and everybody at your school log in at http://<%= @school.domain_name %>.littleredbrick.com. 
<% if @school.teacher_limit == 1 %>
Since you signed up for a personal account, we won't pester you for money. If you decide LittleRedBrick is doing great things, and you want to pester your principal to sign up so we can pester your school for money, that would be great. Smiley-face.
<% else %>
We'll have one of our humans get in touch with you soon to talk about how you want to pay for the <%= @school.teacher_limit %> teacher accounts you signed up for. In the meantime, please feel free to create accounts for everybody and get them all started using the site.
<% end %>

We hope you and your students get a lot out of LittleRedBrick. If you run into any problems, ask us about it in the help forums on the site, which you can find at http://<%= @school.domain_name %>.littleredbrick.com/discussions/help/forums.

Best,
Brian Gates
